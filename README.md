# Submission to sort singly linkedlist in Python & C++.
<p>This repository is as submission for MLH Local Hack Build Day - 3 challenge.</p>
<h2> Algorithm for Python Code: </h2>
<p> We are sorting singly linked list in ascending order.Initially, current point to head node and index will point to node next to current. While traversing through the list till current points to null, by comparing current's data with index's data. If current's data is greater than the index's data, then swapping data between them </p>
<ul>
  <li>Create a class Node which has two attributes: data and next. Next is a pointer to the next node in the list.</li>
  <li>Create another class SortList which has two attributes: head and tail.addNode() will add a new node to the list</li>
  <li>addNode() function will add a new node to the linked list.</li>
  <li>sortList() function will sort the nodes of the linked list in ascending order.</li>
  <li>display() function will display the nodes present in the linked list.</li>
</ul>
<h2> Pre-requisites: </h2>
<ul>
  <li> Knowledge of Linked List Data Structure </li>
  <li> Swapping of numbers or Bubble Sort</li>
  <li> OOPs Concept</li>
</ul>
